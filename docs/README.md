# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This README provides a centralized entry point for understanding our project management practices and accessing all core process documents.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows a comprehensive, structured approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decision-making. Our methodology encompasses the complete project lifecycle—from initial concept through deployment and continuous improvement—ensuring consistent, repeatable execution across all cross-functional initiatives.

The OctoAcme project management framework is built on five core principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery in small testable increments, clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, data-informed decisions based on measurable outcomes, and psychological safety to encourage feedback and learning.

This approach involves clearly defined roles including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who implement features, QA teams who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide input and approvals. Throughout each project, teams maintain key artifacts such as project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, acceptance criteria, risk registers, and retrospective notes to ensure transparency and alignment.

Our project lifecycle moves through five distinct phases, each with specific deliverables and decision gates:

- **Initiation**: Validates business needs and creates a lightweight project plan with clear success metrics and stakeholder alignment.
- **Planning**: Transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with estimated work, identified dependencies, and defined release timelines.
- **Execution**: Teams follow established rhythms including daily standups and weekly syncs while tracking progress through project boards and maintaining quality through comprehensive testing.
- **Release & Deployment**: Employs standardized procedures with pre-release checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans to minimize production risks.
- **Retrospective**: Captures learnings and converts them into actionable improvements that feed back into future projects.

Communication and risk management are woven throughout the entire process, with weekly PM-Product Lead syncs, twice-weekly team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and structured escalation paths for blockers and incidents. Risk registers are actively maintained, dependencies are tracked and escalated proactively, and all stakeholders have access to a single source of truth for project status. This comprehensive approach reduces knowledge silos, accelerates onboarding, ensures consistent project execution, and enables teams to deliver high-quality results reliably and predictably.
